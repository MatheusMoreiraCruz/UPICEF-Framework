# Framework Application Process

## Overview

The UPICEF application process defines a structured sequence of activities designed to evaluate
the structural completeness of urban planning instruments.

The process focuses on identifying whether planning documents include the minimum structural
components required to support planning, monitoring, evaluation, and accountability.

UPICEF does not assess policy effectiveness, content quality, or political alignment.
