# UPICEF – Urban Planning Instruments Completeness Evaluation Framework

UPICEF is a methodological framework designed to evaluate the **structural completeness**
of urban planning instruments produced by governments.

The framework supports public managers, researchers, and evaluators in verifying whether
planning documents include the **minimum structural components** required to support
implementation, monitoring, and accountability.

UPICEF focuses on **structure**, not on policy content, political priorities, or outcomes.

---

## What Is Structural Completeness?

Structural completeness refers to the extent to which a planning instrument explicitly
includes a minimum set of components such as:

- Objectives  
- Goals or targets  
- Indicators  
- Responsibilities  
- Implementation or monitoring mechanisms  

A document may be legally valid and publicly available but still be structurally incomplete.
UPICEF addresses this gap by providing a systematic and transparent evaluation approach.

---

## Purpose of UPICEF

UPICEF was created to:

- Support **diagnostic assessments** of planning documents  
- Increase **transparency and traceability** in public planning  
- Enable **comparative analysis** across instruments or cities  
- Identify **structural gaps** before content or performance evaluations  
- Serve as a **replicable reference** adaptable to different institutional contexts  

---

## Scope of the Framework

UPICEF can be applied to different types of urban planning instruments, including:

- Strategic Planning documents  
- Goals Plans  
- Multi-Year Plans  
- Budget Guidelines Laws  
- Annual Budget Laws  

The framework does not impose a fixed list of instruments.
Each jurisdiction may adapt the instrument set according to its legal and administrative context.

## Core Artifacts in This Repository

This repository contains the following core artifacts that support the conceptual,
methodological, and empirical dimensions of UPICEF.

---

### 📁 Classifications of Planning Instruments

This artifact provides taxonomies used to organize planning instruments according to:

- Planning nature  
- Time horizon  
- Decision-making level  

These classifications support the contextual interpretation of planning instruments and
guide the application of the framework.

---

### 📁 Minimum Components by Planning Instrument

This artifact defines the **Minimum Component Model (MCM)** adopted by UPICEF.

It includes reference definitions for:

- Strategic Planning (SP)  
- Goals Plan (GP)  
- Multi-Year Plan (PPA)  
- Budget Guidelines Law (LDO)  
- Annual Budget Law (LOA)  

Each document describes:

- Conceptual definition  
- Institutional purpose  
- Minimum structural components  
- Justification based on literature and institutional practices  

---

### 📁 Framework Application Process

This artifact describes the operational methodology for applying UPICEF in real-world contexts.

It defines a five-stage application workflow:

1. Document Collection  
2. Component Extraction  
3. Component Comparison  
4. Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis  
5. Interpretation and Discussion  

The process ensures methodological transparency, reproducibility, and analytical consistency
when applying the framework to planning instruments.

### 📁 UPICEF Application – City of São Paulo

This artifact presents an empirical case study demonstrating the application of UPICEF
to the planning instruments of the City of São Paulo (Brazil).

It includes:

- Collected planning instruments  
- Extracted structural components  
- Component comparison matrices  
- Completeness indicators  
- Qualitative and quantitative analysis results  

This case study serves as a proof-of-concept and as a reference for replication in
other cities or institutional contexts.

---

### 📁 Bibliographic References

This artifact consolidates legal, institutional, and academic sources supporting:

- Component definitions  
- Instrument classifications  
- Framework methodological choices  

---

## How UPICEF Should Be Used

The recommended application workflow is:

1. Identify the planning instruments to be evaluated  
2. Collect official planning documents  
3. Extract structural components present in each instrument  
4. Compare extracted components with the UPICEF minimum reference model  
5. Calculate completeness indicators  
6. Interpret structural strengths and gaps  

UPICEF results should be used to support:

- Planning document revision  
- Institutional learning  
- Governance improvement initiatives  

---

## What UPICEF Does Not Do

UPICEF does **not**:

- Evaluate policy quality or effectiveness  
- Assess political priorities or ideological alignment  
- Measure implementation performance  
- Replace content-based or outcome-based evaluations  

UPICEF is a **foundational diagnostic tool**.

---

## Adaptability and Reuse

UPICEF is designed as a **reference framework**, not a rigid model.

- Component names may vary across documents  
- Additional components may be included  
- Legal and institutional contexts may differ  

Functional equivalence and contextual adaptation are encouraged.
