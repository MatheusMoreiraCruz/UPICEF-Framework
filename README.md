# UPICEF – Urban Planning Instruments Completeness Evaluation Framework

UPICEF is a methodological framework designed to evaluate the **structural completeness**
of urban planning instruments produced by governments.

The framework supports public managers, researchers, and evaluators in verifying whether
planning documents include the **minimum structural components** required to support
implementation, monitoring, and accountability.

UPICEF focuses on **structure**, not on policy content, political priorities, or outcomes.

## What Is Structural Completeness?

Structural completeness refers to the extent to which a planning instrument explicitly
includes a minimum set of components such as:

- Objectives
- Goals or targets
- Indicators
- Responsibilities
- Implementation or monitoring mechanisms

A document may be legally valid and publicly available but still be structurally incomplete.
UPICEF addresses this gap by providing a systematic and transparent evaluation approach.

---

## Purpose of UPICEF

UPICEF was created to:

- Support **diagnostic assessments** of planning documents
- Increase **transparency and traceability** in public planning
- Enable **comparative analysis** across instruments or cities
- Identify **structural gaps** before content or performance evaluations
- Serve as a **replicable reference** adaptable to different institutional contexts

---

## Scope of the Framework

UPICEF can be applied to different types of urban planning instruments, including:

- Strategic Planning documents
- Goals Plans
- Multi-Year Plans
- Budget Guidelines Laws
- Annual Budget Laws

The framework does not impose a fixed list of instruments.
Each jurisdiction may adapt the instrument set according to its legal and administrative context.

## Core Artifacts in This Repository

This repository contains the following core artifacts:

### 📁 Classifications of Planning Instruments
- Classification by planning nature
- Classification by time horizon
- Classification by decision level

### 📁 Minimum Components by Planning Instrument
- Strategic Planning (SP)
- Goals Plan (GP)
- Multi-Year Plan (PPA)
- Budget Guidelines Law (LDO)
- Annual Budget Law (LOA)

Each file describes:
- Definition
- Purpose
- Minimum structural components
- Conceptual justification
- Normative or best-practice references

### 📁 Bibliographic References
A consolidated list of legal, institutional, and academic sources used to justify
minimum components and classifications.

## How UPICEF Should Be Used

1. Identify the planning instruments to be evaluated  
2. Extract the structural components explicitly present in each document  
3. Compare extracted components with the UPICEF minimum reference set  
4. Calculate completeness scores  
5. Document structural gaps and strengths  

UPICEF results should be used to support:
- Document revision
- Institutional learning
- Governance improvement initiatives

---

## What UPICEF Does Not Do

UPICEF does **not**:

- Evaluate policy quality or effectiveness
- Assess political priorities or ideological alignment
- Measure implementation performance
- Replace content-based or outcome-based evaluations

It is a **foundational diagnostic tool**.

---

## Adaptability and Reuse

UPICEF is designed as a **reference framework**, not a rigid model.

- Component names may vary
- Additional components may be added
- Legal sources may differ across countries

Functional equivalence and contextual adaptation are encouraged.
