# Minimum Component Model (MCM) Mapping – São Paulo Planning Instruments

This document presents the mapping between the Minimum Component Model (MCM)
defined by the UPICEF Framework and the structural components identified in
planning instruments of the City of São Paulo.

The mapping is based on the official comparison matrices. A correspondence is
considered valid when the intersection between the MCM component and the
document component is marked with "P" in the original analysis.
