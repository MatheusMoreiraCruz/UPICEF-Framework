# Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis

This document presents the results of **Activity 4 – Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis**
of the UPICEF Framework application to the City of São Paulo.

The analysis is based on the comparison between the Minimum Component Model (MCM)
defined by the framework and the structural components identified in each planning instrument.

---

## Quantitative Analysis

### Minimum Components Defined by the UPICEF Framework

The UPICEF Minimum Component Model defines:

**Total Minimum Components = 10**

---

### Summary of Component Matching per Planning Instrument

| Planning Instrument | Matched Components | Minimum Components | Completeness (%) |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Strategic Planning (PE) | 9 | 10 | 75% |
| Goals Plan (PM) | 10 | 10 | 100% |
| Multi-Year Plan (PPA) | 8 | 10 | 83% |
| Budget Guidelines Law (LDO) | 10 | 10 | 100% |
| Annual Budget Law (LOA) | 10 | 10 | 100% |

---

### Completeness Calculation

The completeness percentage for each planning instrument is calculated as:

**Completeness (%) = (Matched Components / Minimum Components) × 100**


This metric allows direct comparison across different types of planning instruments.

and the overall average for the City of São Paulo.

## Qualitative Analysis

The quantitative results reveal significant differences in structural completeness
across planning instruments, reflecting their distinct institutional roles.

### Strategic and Managerial Instruments

- The **Goals Plan (PM)** and **Multi-Year Plan (PPA)** exhibit high levels of
  structural completeness.
- These instruments integrate strategic direction, operational actions,
  monitoring mechanisms, and governance elements.

### Strategic Planning Instrument

- The **Strategic Planning document (PE)** shows a lower completeness level.
- This result is expected, as strategic planning instruments emphasize vision,
  long-term goals, and policy orientation rather than operational and budgetary details.

### Budgetary Instruments

- The **Budget Guidelines Law (LDO)** and **Annual Budget Law (LOA)** achieve full
  completeness with respect to the minimum components.
- Although budgetary instruments are not primarily designed for strategic articulation,
  their strong linkage to programs, actions, and financial execution ensures alignment
  with the framework’s minimum requirements.

## Interpretation

The results demonstrate that the UPICEF Framework is capable of capturing
structural differences across planning instruments while respecting their
institutional specificities.

High completeness values do not necessarily indicate superior planning quality,
but rather structural alignment with the minimum components required to support
planning, monitoring, and accountability.

Lower completeness values, particularly in strategic instruments, reflect
intentional design choices rather than structural deficiencies.

## Methodological Note

The analysis focuses exclusively on structural completeness.
Policy content, effectiveness, and political priorities are outside the scope
of the UPICEF Framework application.
