# Minimum Structural Components for Urban Planning Instruments

This directory presents the minimum structural components recommended for different types of urban planning instruments.

The objective of this material is to support:
- the evaluation of structural completeness of planning documents;
- the identification of missing or weakly specified components;
- transparency regarding the normative or conceptual sources that justify each component.

The components listed here are derived from:
- legal and regulatory requirements;
- internationally recognized good practices in urban planning and public administration;
- academic literature on planning, governance, and policy evaluation.

These components are not intended to prescribe content or policy choices.
Instead, they define the **minimum structural elements** required for planning instruments to be monitorable, assessable, and institutionally operational.

Each file in this directory focuses on a specific planning instrument and presents:
1. The purpose of the instrument;
2. A table of minimum structural components;
3. The source that justifies each component (legal requirement or good practice).
