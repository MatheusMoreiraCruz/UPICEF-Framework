# Classification of Urban Planning Instruments by Temporal Horizon

## Purpose of this Classification

This classification organizes urban planning instruments according to their **expected duration and time span of influence**.  
It helps clarify *how long an instrument is intended to guide public action* and supports coherence across planning documents.

Classifying instruments by temporal horizon helps:
- Identify planning continuity and sequencing;
- Understand how strategic intent is translated into execution;
- Support monitoring and evaluation cycles;
- Analyze planning systems as integrated structures.

## Categories and Definitions

### Long-Term Instruments

Long-term instruments define **strategic orientations and future visions** that extend beyond a single government term.

They typically:
- Address structural challenges and development goals;
- Establish visions and strategic objectives;
- Provide long-lasting guidance for public policies.

**Examples:** Strategic Plans, Development Agendas, Long-term Visions.

---

### Medium-Term Instruments

Medium-term instruments translate long-term directions into **programs and structured objectives** over a defined multi-year period.

They typically:
- Organize policies into programs;
- Define objectives and performance indicators;
- Support managerial coordination.

**Examples:** Goals Plans, Multi-Year Plans (PPA).

---

### Short-Term Instruments

Short-term instruments focus on **annual or operational execution**, enabling immediate implementation of policies.

They typically:
- Authorize expenditures and activities;
- Support financial control and execution;
- Ensure short-cycle monitoring and accountability.

**Examples:** Budget Guidelines Laws (LDO), Annual Budget Laws (LOA).

## Classification Table

| Planning Instrument        | Temporal Horizon |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Strategic Planning (SP)    | Long-term       |
| Goals Plan (GP)            | Medium-term     |
| Multi-Year Plan (PPA)      | Medium-term     |

## Relevance for Structural Evaluation

Different temporal horizons imply **different structural requirements**, especially regarding:
- Indicators and targets;
- Monitoring mechanisms;
- Update and revision cycles.

Recognizing the temporal horizon prevents inappropriate structural expectations during completeness assessment.
