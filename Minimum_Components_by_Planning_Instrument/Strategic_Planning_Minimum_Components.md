# Minimum Structural Components — Strategic Planning

## Purpose of Strategic Planning

Strategic Planning instruments define long-term directions, priorities, and commitments that guide public action.
They provide a shared vision and establish the foundations for subsequent managerial and budgetary planning instruments.

From a structural perspective, strategic plans must clearly articulate their objectives, challenges, and monitoring mechanisms to support continuity, evaluation, and institutional learning.

## Minimum Structural Components

| Minimum Component | Description | Source |
|------------------|-------------|--------|
| Challenges | Identification of major structural or contextual challenges to be addressed | Good practice (strategic planning literature) |
| Mission | Explicit statement of the institutional purpose | Good practice |
| Vision | Long-term aspirational description of the desired future | Good practice |
| Strategic Objectives | Clearly defined long-term objectives | Good practice |
| Goals / Targets | Measurable or time-bound goals linked to objectives | Good practice |
| Strategies | Broad approaches or lines of action to achieve objectives | Good practice |
| Implementation Plan | Description of how strategies will be operationalized | Good practice |
| Indicators | Metrics to monitor progress toward objectives and goals | Good practice |

## Notes

- The absence of some traditional components (e.g., mission or vision) does not necessarily invalidate the instrument,
  but may reduce its structural completeness.
- Additional components may be included depending on local context or institutional practices.
