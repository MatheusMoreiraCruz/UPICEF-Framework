# Classification of Urban Planning Instruments by Decision Level

## Purpose of this Classification

This classification organizes urban planning instruments according to the **type of decision they primarily support** within public administration.

It clarifies *who uses the instrument and for what kind of decision*, supporting both governance analysis and structural evaluation.

This classification helps:
- Distinguish strategic, managerial, and operational decision-making;
- Align instruments with institutional responsibilities;
- Support accountability and monitoring structures.

## Categories and Definitions

### Strategic Decision Level

Instruments at the strategic decision level support **high-level policy direction and institutional orientation**.

They typically:
- Guide political and strategic choices;
- Define priorities and long-term objectives;
- Support leadership and governance decisions.

---

### Tactical (Managerial) Decision Level

Instruments at the tactical level support **coordination, management, and programmatic decisions**.

They typically:
- Translate strategy into structured actions;
- Allocate responsibilities across units;
- Enable monitoring of programs and initiatives.

**Examples:** Goals Plans, Multi-Year Plans (PPA).

---

### Operational Decision Level

Instruments at the operational level support **day-to-day execution and resource management**.

## Relevance for Structural Evaluation

Each decision level requires **different structural elements**, such as:
- Vision and objectives at the strategic level;
- Programs, indicators, and responsibilities at the tactical level;
- Budgets, projects, and execution controls at the operational level.

This distinction is essential for fair and consistent completeness assessment.
