# Classification of Urban Planning Instruments by Nature

## Purpose of this Classification

The classification by **nature** aims to distinguish urban planning instruments according to their **primary institutional function** within public administration. This perspective helps clarify *why* a document exists and *what role* it plays in supporting decision-making, coordination, and implementation.

Understanding the nature of planning instruments is essential for:
- Structuring planning systems coherently  
- Avoiding overlaps between documents  
- Defining appropriate expectations regarding content and use
