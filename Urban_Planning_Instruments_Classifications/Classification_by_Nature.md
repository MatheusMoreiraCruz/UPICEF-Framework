# Classification of Urban Planning Instruments by Nature

## Purpose of this Classification

This classification organizes urban planning instruments according to their **primary institutional function** within public administration.  
The goal is to clarify *what each instrument is mainly designed to do* in the planning and governance process, independently of its duration or legal form.

Classifying instruments by nature helps:
- Understand their role in public governance;
- Distinguish strategic intent from operational execution;
- Support structural evaluation frameworks such as UPICEF;
- Enable comparison across different institutional contexts.

## Categories and Definitions

### Political Planning Instruments

Political planning instruments are focused on **defining strategic directions, visions, and public commitments**.  
They establish priorities, values, and long-term orientations that guide public action.

These instruments typically:
- Express government intentions and strategic choices;
- Set broad objectives and visions;
- Provide guidance rather than operational detail.

**Examples:** Strategic Plans, Development Agendas, Vision Statements.

---

### Managerial Planning Instruments

Managerial planning instruments translate political intentions into **organized programs, objectives, and actions**.  
They bridge strategy and execution by structuring what should be done and how.

These instruments typically:
- Define programs, goals, and initiatives;
- Support coordination across administrative units;
- Enable monitoring and management of public action.

**Examples:** Goals Plans, Multi-Year Plans, Sectoral Action Plans.

---

### Budgetary Planning Instruments

Budgetary planning instruments are responsible for **allocating and authorizing financial resources** required to implement public policies.  
They operationalize planning by linking actions to budgetary execution.

These instruments typically:
- Specify revenues and expenditures;
- Authorize spending for programs and projects;
- Support financial control and accountability.

**Examples:** Budget Guidelines Laws, Annual Budget Laws.

## Relevance for Structural Evaluation

From a structural perspective, instruments of different natures are expected to contain **different minimum components**.  
This distinction is essential for completeness assessment, as it prevents evaluating all instruments using the same structural expectations.


## Relevance to UPICEF

This classification supports the UPICEF framework by clarifying the **expected structural components** of each type of instrument, avoiding inappropriate comparisons between documents with different institutional purposes.
