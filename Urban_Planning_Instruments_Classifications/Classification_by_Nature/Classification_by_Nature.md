# Classification of Urban Planning Instruments by Nature

## Purpose and Rationale

The classification of urban planning instruments by **nature** aims to distinguish documents according to their primary institutional role within public administration. This classification helps clarify *what each instrument is intended to do*, regardless of its content or legal form.

By categorizing instruments according to their nature, planners and public managers can better understand how political intentions are translated into managerial coordination and, ultimately, into budget execution. This perspective is especially useful for structuring planning systems, identifying overlaps, and supporting completeness evaluations.

## Classification Categories

Urban planning instruments are classified into three main categories according to their nature:

- **Political Planning**
- **Managerial Planning**
- **Budgetary Planning**

## Classification Table

| Urban Planning Instrument | Classification by Nature | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Strategic Planning | Political Planning | Defines long-term visions, strategic directions, and political commitments that guide public action. |
| Goals Plan | Managerial Planning | Translates strategic priorities into measurable goals and initiatives to be monitored during a government term. |
| Multi-Year Plan (PPA) | Managerial Planning | Organizes government programs, objectives, and actions into a structured planning cycle. |
| Budget Guidelines Law (LDO) | Budgetary Planning | Establishes fiscal priorities and budget execution rules for a specific fiscal year. |
| Annual Budget Law (LOA) | Budgetary Planning | Allocates financial resources to programs, projects, and actions, enabling operational execution. |

## Practical Implications

This classification supports:
- Understanding the functional role of each planning instrument
- Identifying missing or redundant documents in planning systems
- Structuring completeness assessments based on institutional purpose
- Improving coherence between political intent, management, and budget execution
