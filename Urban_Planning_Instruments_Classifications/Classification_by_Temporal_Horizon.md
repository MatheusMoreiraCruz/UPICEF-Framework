# Classification of Urban Planning Instruments by Temporal Horizon

## Purpose and Rationale

The classification of urban planning instruments by **temporal horizon** organizes documents according to the time span in which they are intended to guide decision-making and public action.

This classification helps clarify *when* each instrument operates within the planning cycle and supports analyses of continuity, coherence, and planning maturity. It is particularly useful for understanding how strategic intentions are translated into executable actions over time.

## Temporal Categories

Urban planning instruments are commonly grouped into three temporal horizons:

- **Long-Term**
- **Medium-Term**
- **Short-Term**

## Classification Table

| Urban Planning Instrument | Temporal Horizon | Description |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Strategic Planning | Long-Term | Establishes long-range visions and strategic objectives for urban development. |
| Goals Plan | Medium-Term | Defines goals and initiatives aligned with a specific government mandate. |
| Multi-Year Plan (PPA) | Medium-Term | Structures programs and actions over a multi-year planning cycle. |
| Budget Guidelines Law (LDO) | Short-Term | Sets annual fiscal priorities and budgetary constraints. |
| Annual Budget Law (LOA) | Short-Term | Authorizes annual expenditures and operational execution. |

## Practical Implications

This classification supports:
- Analysis of planning continuity across time
- Identification of gaps between strategy and execution
- Evaluation of alignment between long-term objectives and short-term actions
- Comparative analysis between cities or planning systems
